        "facts": "An expedition in 1924 resulted in one of the greatest mysteries on Everest to this day: George Mallory and Andrew Irvine made a final summit attempt on 8 June but never returned, sparking debate as to whether or not they were the first to reach the top. They had been spotted high on the mountain that day but disappeared in the clouds, never to be seen again, until Mallory's body was found in 1999 at 8,155 m (26,755 ft) on the north face. Officially, the peak was first reached by Sir Edmund Hillary of New Zealand and Sherpa of Nepal Tenzing Norgay in 1953.",

        "facts": "The oceanic pole of inaccessibility was officially discovered in 1992 by survey engineer Hrvoje Lukatela. The pole has been nicknamed Point Nemo, after author Jules Verne's famous Captain Nemo. The name also means \"no-one\" in Latin, which is fitting because Point Nemo is so far from land, that the nearest humans are often astronauts. The International Space Station orbits the Earth at a maximum of 258 miles (416 km), meanwhile the nearest landmass is Ducie Island, an uninhabited atoll in the Pitcairn Islands, over 1,670 miles (2,700 km) away.",
