Between 2001 and 2009, the population increased to 30,000 people from just a small gold prospector camp because the price of gold rose 235% over that period.",

        "facts": "The oceanic pole of inaccessibility was officially discovered in 1992 by survey engineer Hrvoje Lukatela. The pole has been nicknamed Point Nemo, after author Jules Verne's famous Captain Nemo. The name also means \"no-one\" in Latin, which is fitting because Point Nemo is so far from land, that the nearest humans are often astronauts. The International Space Station orbits the Earth at a maximum of 258 miles (416 km), meanwhile the nearest landmass is Ducie Island, an uninhabited atoll in the Pitcairn Islands, over 1,670 miles (2,700 km) away.",
